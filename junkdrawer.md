# 1.10.24 check off list:
### Laura started building a diagram for a visual aid of how we're organizing our classes
### We now have our fixture files and the whole repo set up with our gems

### Everyone has the repo plus the spec harness set up on their computer as well

###  We created the team class and team factory class that makes Team objects out of the CSV data for the teams

### Dana and Nico are using that framework now to build out the Game and GameFactory and GameTeam and GameTeamFactory classes to do the same with the other two data sets



## Next we can probably start to figure out together how we want to:
1. Build our StatTracker class
2. Decide if we want separate classes to hold the logic for the methods that we are instructed to have work on the StatTracker, or just build them there
3. See if anything about our initial plans need to change or be reorganized with the new info we got from the meeting today
4. Maybe update our tasks on the github project too to make sure we're capturing the things that we did today and check them off?
