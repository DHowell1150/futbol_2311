## Group Retro 1/12/24
Format: [DAKI](https://www.teamretro.com/retrospectives)

### Drop:
- Thinking too far ahead of where we are at
    - Took a lot of time initially trying to plan our code design while still not realizing the intracacies of the code that we needed to write
        - This ended up with us replanning a few times before we got into actually writing our code

### Add:
- Looking more closely at the technical requirements/code needed before we start to make design choices
- Add more detail to our closing summary each day
    - Bullet pointing what's left for ourselves or each other

### Keep:
- Working very well as a team
- Able to set ourselves up to be able to work asychronously as well
- Checking in with the human behind the screen before anything else
- Ending our day with the summary of what's been done and what our gameplan is for the next day
- Keeping communication respectful while still being able to call out things that may be blocking us

### Improve:
- Taking more poms or moments to refresh our eyes, brains, bodies, etc.
- Look more closely at what code we will need to write
- Making more informed planning decisions
    - Looking through the rubric more often
    - Looking at our technical requirements more closely and breaking them down more thoroughly
